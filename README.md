## Guidelines for Coding Assignment 1:
>You must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered desktop, tablet, and mobile. 
>
>1. The browser should display a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. 
>
>2. Tablet view should appear only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. 
>
>3. Mobile view should appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.
>
>Your site is very simple. 
>
>* It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it >dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. 
>
>* How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (**Hint: use media queries.**)
>
>* You are NOT allowed to use any CSS (or Javascript) framework for this assignment, including Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework. No >framework CSS files should even be referenced in your index.html, even if you are not using them.
>
> **Layout:** 
>* In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the ?>browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the >'float' property.) 
>
>* In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The >3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself.
>
>* In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row.
>
> **Section Title Region:**
>Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the >view(desktop, tablet or mobile).
>
> **Spacing:**
>* Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). 
>
>* Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser window. 
>
>* Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the dummy text is >"pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region.
>
> **Borders and Colors:**
>* Each section should have a background color set to some color (of your choosing). 
>
>* Set the background color of each section title region to some unique color (of your choosing). 
>
>* Make sure that the background color still allows the user to view the text in the section and section title regions.
>
>* Depending on the color you choose, you may want to change the color of the text so it can be easy to read. Set a black border on both >the section and section title region that is 1px thick.
